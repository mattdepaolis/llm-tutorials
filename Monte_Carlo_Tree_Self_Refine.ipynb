            "The answer provided demonstrates a good understanding of the concept, with a clear and concise recalculation of the sum of interior angles of a polygon using the formula (n-2) × 180°. The student also mentions an alternative approach of summing up the angles between each pair of adjacent sides, showing awareness of the different methods. However, there are a few minor issues that could be improved:\n",
